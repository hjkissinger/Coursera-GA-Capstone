## Google Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bikeshare (2023-02-16) :bike:

This case study is from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. There's a very good reason why this project is so popular! I had a lot of fun diving into this messy dataset. For this article, I have included my thought process while preparing, processing, and analyzing the data. I expanded upon the analyses provided by the Google Analytics R-Script. The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out my [R Script](link here) and [Tableau](link here) visualizations to follow along! :smiley:
