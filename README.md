## Google Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bikes (2023-02-16) :bike:

This case study is from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. I have included my thought process while preparing, processing, and analyzing the data. I expanded upon the analyses provided by the Google Analytics R-Script. Tools used for this project were R and Tableau.
