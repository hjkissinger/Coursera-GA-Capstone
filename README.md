## Google Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bikeshare (2023-02-16) :bike:

This case study on Cyclistic Bikeshare is from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. I had a lot of fun diving into this messy dataset. There's a very good reason why this project is so popular for data analyst portfolios! The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out my R Script to follow along or head to my [Tableau](link here) visualizations to see the end result! :smiley:

This is the first article of a two part series:

* [Part I](link here) focuses on the process of cleaning data and turning it into insights. 
* [Part II](link here) focuses on the analysis and sharing of insights through visualizations.
