This case study is from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. I have included my thought process while preparing and processing the data, as well as analyses not explored by the original study. Tools used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out my [blog](link here), [R Script](link here), and [Tableau](link here) visualizations to follow along!
