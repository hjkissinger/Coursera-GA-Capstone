## Google Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bikeshare (2023-02-22) :bike: :bike: :bike:

The Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study is from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. The goal of this project was to determine factors that differentiate annual members and casual bike riders. These factors are then used to develop recommendations for a marketing campaign that aims to increase the membership conversion rate. 

I had a lot of fun diving into this messy dataset. There's a very good reason why this project is so popular for data analyst portfolios! The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out the <a href= https://github.com/hjkissinger/Coursera-GA-Capstone/tree/main/R-scripts>R Scripts</a> to follow along or head to my <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleAnalyticsCapstoneCyclisticBikeSharePTI/CyclisticBikeShareCaseStudy?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Tableau</a> visualizations to see the end result! :smiley:
